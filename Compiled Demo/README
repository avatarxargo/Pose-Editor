___ manual ___
The Bone Editor can display the list of bones in several configurations:
- hierarchy ON: 	Shows bones ordered from root to children with indentations.
- hierarchy OFF: 	Show bones in the same order as they are listed in the .csv file.
- simple ON: 		Only displays bone name, add child and delete keys.
- simple OFF: 		Displays full bone controls.

The file menu consists of four options:
- New:		Creates an entirely blank project.
- Open:		Brings up an opening dialog to browse for a file to open.
- Save:		If the file has been saved or opened, saves to that location.
- Save as:	Brings up a saving dialog to choose an output path.

If the application is closed while the current working file is unsaved, the user
will be shown a warning message with an option to cancel.

Full bone controls:
- mini-buttons:
	.move up: 	Shifts the bone up in the csv ordering of bones.
	.move down: Shifts the bone down in the csv ordering of bones.
	.add child: Creates a new bone with a procedurally unique name as a child.
	.remove: 	Removes this bone. All children are assigned to this bone's parent.
- name:		Changes the display name.
- parent: 	Dropdown selection of a parent node / [Root]. Multiple root elements are permited.
- angle:	Euler angle controls.
